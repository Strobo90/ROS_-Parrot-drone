# ROS Mini Drone Flight Control

Overview
This project utilizes the Robot Operating System (ROS) to control a mini drone. The goal is to provide a flexible and modular framework for controlling the drone's flight behavior, enabling users to experiment with various flight algorithms and behaviors.



Features
ROS Integration: Leveraging the power of ROS, this project provides a standardized communication interface for controlling the drone and receiving sensor data.
Modular Architecture: The flight control system is designed with modularity in mind, allowing users to easily swap out components such as flight controllers, sensors, and algorithms.
Simulation Support: Simulate the drone's flight behavior in various environments using ROS-compatible simulators such as Gazebo or AirSim.
API Documentation: Comprehensive documentation is provided for the APIs and interfaces, making it easy for users to integrate custom functionalities or extend the existing ones.
Sample Applications: Included are sample applications demonstrating basic flight maneuvers, autonomous navigation, and more.

Prerequisites
ROS (Robot Operating System) installed on the system. 
Compatible mini drone with ROS integration.
